1. Are your programs accepted?
My "Hello World" program was accepted, but not the other one.

2. Why the programs are/aren't accepted?
My "cold" program functionally works as described, but the format is probably not exactly what the website's compiler wants it to be like.

3. What did you learn from this excercise?
I learned that 'cin' can inherently skip whitespace in order to read multiple inputs.

4. Anything else you want to communicate with the instructor?
Not for now.
